The Pharmacy Delivery Web Application is a user-friendly platform designed to simplify access to essential medications. It allows customers to browse a curated list of common medicines, add items to a virtual cart, and securely place orders by entering their delivery details. With a clean interface and intuitive controls, users can quickly select products like Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, or Cough Syrup, view their total cost, and confirm their order with just a few clicks. This front-end prototype demonstrates how digital tools can enhance healthcare accessibility, especially for individuals who may have difficulty visiting physical pharmacies. Future enhancements could include prescription uploads, real-time tracking, and integration with payment gateways to create a seamless and reliable healthcare experience.
